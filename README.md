# LineSimplification_Gurobi_Optimizer
In topographic maps contour lines are used to depict the height reliefs of landscapes. However, extracting contour lines from raster data often results in highly detailed polylines. In a post-processing step the contour lines can be simplified to reduce storage consumption and visual clutter. In this exercise this post-processing step is implemented. We can assume that the contour lines are given as pairwise non-intersecting polylines1 Each polyline P should then be simplified such that its self-intersection-free simplification lies in an error tolerance of P() and no two simplified polylines intersect.
The objective is to minimize the total number of vertices.

Extract from a height map a set of contour lines, which will be used for testing the algorithms.
simple heuristic for simplifying contour lines is developed.

a) Use QGis to extract the contour lines (step size: 10m) from the given file map.tiff.
b) Store the polylines in a comma separated file (csv) using an appropriate projection.
With each polyline also store its height.
c) Write a Java-Class that can be used to read in the .csv file.

d) Visualize the polylines using the class Viewer (found in Viewer.java). Depending on the height, the color of the contour lines should be chosen.
Step 2. Develop an integer linear programming formulation for simplifying a single contour line respecting an error tolerance Îµ. The formulation should be based on a shortcut graph.
Step 3. Extend your formulation to multiple contour lines such that the result is a set of pairwise non-intersecting polylines.
Step 4. Implement the integer linear programming formulation.
Step 5. Test the integer linear programming formulation for different error tolerances and
different data sets.
Step 6. Develop a simple algorithm based on the shortcut graph that finds a solution in polynomial time. Compare the results with those of the integer linear programming formulation.
